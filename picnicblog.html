            <h2>Picnic trip</h2>
            <marquee direction="up">             
                Going on a trip travelling and hanging out with our family and friends is always an
                extremely good thing it is always a pleasant experience that you get the chance to 
                mix up with your dear friends in a deeper way despite 
                The fact that I have a great deal of time to spend with my friends in school it is 
                likewise ideal to spend time with other different spots like shopping malls beaches 
                hills or even at their homes or any suitable place for gathering.
                Whenever we go out for hanging out we spend some pleasant time together sometimes we 
                like to watch movies in the cinema or play video games it is a great source of 
                amusement entertainment one gets from being among friends is always unforgettable 
                personally 
                We started our journey early in the morning. We went there by car. It took one and 
                half an hour to reach there. 
                It was a distance of 60 km from our home to our picnic spot. It was a beautiful spot 
                beside the Ganges. Many picnic parties went there. 
                We spent the time joyfully. We visited different kinds of trees flowers and grasses. 
                It was an amazing place to explore. 
                We played Cricket, Badminton. Some lay idle and listened to music. We also ate a lot. 
                In the evening we enjoyed boating on the river. We also enjoyed the glorious sunset. 
                Then we returned home with a very happy mind.
                I think that going with your friends is the most ideal approach to travel regardless 
                of whether this implies hiking around the country for a year or simply taking an end 
                of the week outing to another city I forcefully suggest the experience 
                but sometimes it is also very risky to be with friends in some place which is not in 
                the knowledge of your parents I have had a very interesting experience 
                last year in march 2019 I went with my five friends to Alcor beach to enjoy some 
                moments of life there it was the first time 
                when I took a short one-day trip only with my friends since my childhood my family 
                has always taken me on trips on weekends this time I took a decision to spend some time 
                with my friends on the beach and cooking for ourselves this seemed something 
                Specious to my parents but I insisted and my parents gave permission half-heartedly 
                but they knew that adult children should learn to see the world outside their home with 
                their own eyes 
                Anyhow I got permission we bought different essential foodstuff from the market and set 
                out on a short journey after reaching there we found peacefulness and serenity all 
                around us on the beach this part of our trip was the time of quiescence no rush and 
                noise was there it was the 12:30 pm and a good time for lunch
