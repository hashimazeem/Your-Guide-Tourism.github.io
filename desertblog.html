            <h2>Cholistan Desert</h2>
            <marquee direction="up"> 
                We went on the cholistan desert last Jun and it was a great family experience in many ways.
                Thanks to the other trip advisor review, we decided to go with ABC tour and no issue with
                our tour, from pick up, activities and food. It was in summer and the weather did reach 
                close to 40 on 1 day during our trip. However, the afternoon tour we took was just weather
                perfect as we didn't feel hot the whole time, maybe a little bit hot when the boys climbed 
                up the dune for sand board. We were pick up from the hotel then off to the nearby hotel to 
                pick up another couple who share our tour the whole time and as it was off season due to summer, 
                we had extra attention which was good. After a not too long drive out over 1 hour with very 
                knowledgeable guide who gave us good information to keep us entertained, we arrived the main 
                attraction of the tour for sand dunes bashing.<br>
                The jumping jeep ride, the red desert, the camel ride, the dance, the cold nights and the food.... 
                everything is ultimate.<br>
                I personally screamed the whole time with my eyes closed and everybody else just had a great time. 
                It was very scary for me but again, Disney Land Space Mountain was the scariest ride ever and was 
                my limit, so you most likely will enjoy the fun .<br> 
                There, a few dozen of participants were guided to the tour of their choice: the Vintage Land Rover
                tour or the camel riding tour. We had opted for the last one and the camels, attached in groups or
                three, were eagerly awaiting us. We were given an adventure pack with a stainless steel water bottle
                and a staff member kindly tied our bedouin-styled headscarf.<br>
                Our desert safari started with a timely pick-up at 14.30 p.m. in our Jumeirah hotel by Jafar, our 
                friendly guide for the day. Another couple, who also stayed in our hotel, joined us for the ride in 
                the Toyota Land Cruiser. After about an hour, and after a quick stop at the Al Marmoom Camel Race Track,
                we reached the meeting point in the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve.
