            <h2>Trip to village in Kangra</h2>
            <marquee direction="up"> 
                I am a passionate traveler to hills and especially to my village Barram in Teh
                (Jaisinghpur Kangra district HP). I used to visit my place during the summer 
                vacation while being in school and would wait desperately for the next summer 
                vacations so that could visit it again. With higher studies, job and responsibilities, 
                I did not get many chances to visit my village and spend even a month there.
                In fact I once visited it after a good five year gap! But during these five 
                years the longing to visit my “Gaon” never died. In fact, it became stronger 
                by the day. During this “gap” I could not escape from my madness to visit hills 
                and would plan trip with friends for two or three days to Shimla, Manali, Rohtang, 
                Mussorie etc and would try to see my village in the homes, rivers, khadds, buses 
                and people there.
                
                So enough of history (my favourite subject)! Finally, when I bought a car i10
                (I must call it an achievement) , I decided to go there in car with my parents 
                (have been going in HRTC buses and I must say that journey in these roadways 
                buses is equally exciting and sometimes even more than car seeing the sun rising 
                from the window of your seat and feeling the chill of the air on your face is 
                absolutely maddening ) . The idea to go there in car still fills me(though went 
                there in sep-oct-2010) with the joy, the happiness, the relax, the feelings and 
                all the good emotions! I was ready, though little scared, (the very idea of driving 
                on single hilly roads and giving pass to buses trucks etc would make me mute) 
                My dad who is an immaculate driver for sure was a great encouraging company 
                and my mother a great “sawaari”.
                A village shop and my sweet car
                ME IN CAR
                So all the PACKING was done (typed in caps because you can’t imagine the kind 
                of stuff my car carried) Next day we were ready and I had the steering in my 
                hands and at 5.30 AM noted down the KMs and the journey began. During those days 
                it was raining heavily and that day it rained with double or may be triple power 
                but let me tell you that it just cant be explained in words the joy of driving in 
                rain and that too on Delhi Panipat road.It was raining so heavily that on few 
                occasions the wiper would prove to be futile. The road is excellentisimo (simo 
                a superlative in Spanish) you just don’t feel tired!!
                On way to my village
